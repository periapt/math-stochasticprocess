Math-StochasticProcess

One defines a stochastic process by inheriting from the
Math::StochasticProcess::Event class and implementing the virtual
functions. The process can be run until all events have become
resolved (or else have probabilities that have dipped below a
tolerance parameter).

As an added convenience one may use the Math::StochasticProcess::Event::Tuple
class which derives from the Event class. This represents a tuple of random
variables. This defines all undefined base functions, apart from "iterate" which
actually defines what how an Event moves to the next iteration.
